## Pokemon Genetics Probability Calculator (Gen 6 and currently onward)

This version uses the "marble" approach to calculate possibilities:<br>
Each of the 12 IVs from the parents are a "marble",
and (depending on your inclusion of Destiny Knot) 3 or 5 marbles are selected to be passed to the baby Pokemon.<br>
This calculator considers the chance of when IVs overlap, such as when the HP IVs of both parents are selected to be passed down.

This is a new version of a probability calculator I created a few years ago, with several changes made:

The calculator now includes the option for the Pokemon to hold an Everstone<br>
When taking Pokemon Natures into consideration with the probability calculation, it's assumed that the Pokemon carrying the Everstone will have the correct/desired Nature that the player is looking for.

A new UI has been implemented, with the intended goal of being more compact, intuitive, and easy to use.

This program follows the breeding mechanics for Pokemon games from generation 6 and onward.<br>
