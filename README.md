## Pokemon Genetics Probability Calculator (Gen 6 and currently onward)

This is a new version of a probability calculator I created a few years ago, with several changes made:

The calculator now includes the option for the Pokemon to hold an Everstone<br>
When taking Pokemon Natures into consideration with the probability calculation, it's assumed that the Pokemon carrying the Everstone will have the correct/desired Nature that the player is looking for.

A new UI has been implemented, with the intended goal of being more compact, intuitive, and easy to use.

This program follows the breeding mechanics for Pokemon games from generation 6 and onward.<br>

* Omega Ruby

* X
* Y
