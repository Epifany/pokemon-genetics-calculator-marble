## Pokemon Genetics Probability Calculator (Gen 6 and currently onward)

This is a new version of a probability calculator I created a few years ago, with several changes made:

The calculator now includes the option for the Pokemon to hold an Everstone<br>
When taking Pokemon Natures into consideration with the probability calculation, it's assumed that the Pokemon carrying the Everstone will have the correct/desired Nature that the player is looking for.

A new UI has been implemented, with the intended goal of being more compact, intuitive, and easy to use.

This version adds a new approach (algorithm) to calculating probabilities<br>
The old version uses a "marble" approach:<br>
Each of the 12 IVs from the parents are a "marble",
and (depending on your choice of items i.e. Destiny Knot) a certain amount of marbles are selected to be passed to the baby Pokemon.<br>
This calculator considers the chance of when IVs overlap, such as when the HP IVs of both parents are selected to be passed down.<br>
The new version adds the "slot" approach:<br>
The program chooses 3, 5, or some other amount (depending on your choice of items) out of the 6 type of stats (e.g. HP, Atk, Def, SpA, SpD, Spe).
Afterwards, for each stat chosen, it randomly selects an IV from either parents for the baby Pokemon to inherit.<br><br>

This program follows the breeding mechanics for Pokemon games from generation 6 and onward.<br>
